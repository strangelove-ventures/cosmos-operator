# cosmos-operator
Cosmos Operator manages custom resource definitions (CRDs) for full nodes (aka RPC nodes) and eventually validator nodes for blockchains created with the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk).

## CosmosFullNode

The CosmosFullNode creates a highly available, fault-tolerant [full node](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/run-node/run-node.html) deployment.

The CosmosFullNode controller acts like a hybrid between a StatefulSet and a Deployment.
Like a StatefulSet, each pod has a corresponding persistent volume to manage blockchain state and data.
You can configure rolling updates similar to a Deployment.

Additionally, because full node persistent data can be destroyed and recreated with little consequence, the controller 
will destroy/recreate PVCs which is different from StatefulSets which never delete PVCs.
Deleting a CosmosFullNode also cleans up PVCs.

## Validators?

Coming soon!

## Getting Started

Run these commands to setup your environment:

```shell
make tools
```

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cosmos-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cosmos-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

# Best Practices

### Volumes, PVCs and StorageClass

Generally, Volumes are bound to a single Availability Zone (AZ). Therefore, use or define a [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
which has `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`. This way, kubernetes will not provision the volume until there is a pod ready to bind to it.

If you do not configure `volumeBindingMode` to wait, you risk the scheduler ignoring pod topology rules such as `Affinity`.
For example, in GKE, volumes will be provisioned [in random zones](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/persistent-volumes).

The Operator cannot define a StorageClass for you. Instead, you must configure the CRD with a pre-existing StorageClass.

Cloud providers generally provide default StorageClasses for you. Some of them set `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` such as GKE's `premium-rwo`.
```shell
kubectl get storageclass
```

Additionally, Cosmos nodes require heavy disk IO. Therefore, choose a faster StorageClass such as GKE's `premium-rwo`.

## Using Volume Snapshots

TODO: How to use snapscheduler to create and restore from a kubernetes volume snapshot.

# Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

## Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

## Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
