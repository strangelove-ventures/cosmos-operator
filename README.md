# Cosmos Operator
Cosmos Operator is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for blockchains built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). 

The long-term vision of this operator is to allow you to "configure it and forget it". 

## Motivation

Kubernetes provides a foundation for creating highly-available, scalable, fault-tolerant applications. 
Additionally, Kubernetes provides well-known DevOps patterns and abstractions vs. 
traditional DevOps which often requires "re-inventing the wheel".

Furthermore, the Operator Pattern allows us to mix infrastructure with business logic, 
thus minimizing human intervention and human error.

# Disclaimers

* Only tested on GKE. Although kubernetes is portable, YMMV with AWS, Azure, or other kubernetes providers. Or it may not work at all.
* Requires a recent version of kubernetes: v1.23+.
* CosmosFullNode: The chain must be built from the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
* CosmosFullNode: The controller requires [heighliner](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner) images. If you build your own image, you will need a shell `sh` and set the uid:gid to 1025:1025.
* CosmosFullNode: May not work with all chains built with the Cosmos SDK. (Some chains diverge from common conventions.)

# CRDs

## CosmosFullNode

API Version: v1

The CosmosFullNode controller acts like a hybrid between a StatefulSet and a Deployment.
Like a StatefulSet, each pod has a corresponding persistent volume to manage persisted blockchain data.
But, you can also configure rolling updates similar to a Deployment.

CosmosFullNode gives you more control over individual pod and pvc pairs than a StatefulSet.

CosmosFullNode is v1 and stable. Future changes should not be backwards breaking. 
As of this writing, Strangelove has been running CosmosFullNode in production for several weeks.

View a [minimal example](./config/samples/cosmos_v1_cosmosfullnode.yaml) or a [full example](./config/samples/cosmos_v1_cosmosfullnode_full.yaml).

## StatefulJob

API Version: v1alpha1

The StatefulJob is a means to process persistent data from a recent [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) of a PVC created from a CosmosFullNode. 
It periodically creates a job and PVC using the most recent VolumeSnapshot as its data source. It mounts the PVC as a volume into all of the job's pods. 
It's similar to a CronJob but does not offer advanced scheduling via a crontab. 

Strangelove uses it to compress and upload snapshots of chain data.

Currently, it is alpha and will likely have backwards breaking changes. At this time, we do not recommend using it in production.
