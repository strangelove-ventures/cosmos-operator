Cosmos Operator is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for blockchains built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). 

The long-term vision of this operator is to allow you to "configure it and forget it". 

## Motivation

Kubernetes provides a foundation for creating highly-available, scalable, fault-tolerant applications. 
Additionally, Kubernetes provides well-known DevOps patterns and abstractions vs. 
traditional DevOps which often requires "re-inventing the wheel".

Furthermore, the Operator Pattern allows us to mix infrastructure with business logic, 
thus minimizing human intervention and human error.

# Disclaimers

* Tested on Google's GKE and Bare-metal with Kubeadm. Although kubernetes is portable, we cannot guarantee or provide support for AWS, Azure, or other kubernetes providers.
* Requires a recent version of kubernetes: v1.23+.
* CosmosFullNode: The chain must be built from the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
* CosmosFullNode: Validator sentries require a remote signer such as [horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux).
* CosmosFullNode: The controller requires [heighliner](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner) images. If you build your own image, you will need a shell `sh` and set the uid:gid to 1025:1025. If running as a validator sentry, you need `sleep` as well.
* CosmosFullNode: May not work for all Cosmos chains. (Some chains diverge from common conventions.) Strangelove has yet to encounter a Cosmos chain that does not work with this operator.

# CosmosFullNode CRD

Status: v1, stable

CosmosFullNode is the flagship CRD. Its purpose is to deploy highly-available, fault-tolerant blockchain nodes. 

The CosmosFullNode controller is like a StatefulSet for running Cosmos SDK blockchains.

A CosmosFullNode can be configured to run as an RPC node, a validator sentry, or a seed node. All configurations can
be used as persistent peers.

As of this writing, Strangelove has been running CosmosFullNode in production for many months.

[Full example yaml](./config/samples/cosmos_v1_cosmosfullnode_full.yaml)

### Why not a StatefulSet?
Each pod requires different config, such as peer settings in config.toml and mounted node keys. Therefore, a blanket
template as found in StatefulSet did not suffice.

Additionally, CosmosFullNode gives you more control over individual pod and pvc pairs vs. a StatefulSet to help
the human operator debug and recover from situations such as a corrupted PVCs.

# Support CRDs

These CRDs are part of the operator and serve to support CosmosFullNodes.

# Roadmap

Disclaimer: Strangelove has not committed to these enhancements and cannot estimate when they will be completed.

- [ ] Scheduled upgrades. Set a halt height and image version. The controller performs a rolling update with the new image version after the committed halt height.
- [x] Support configuration suitable for validator sentries.
- [x] Reliable, persistent peer support.
- [x] Quicker p2p discovery using private peers.
- [ ] Advanced readiness probe behavior. (The CometBFT rpc status endpoint is not always reliable.)
- [x] Automatic rollout for PVC resizing. (Currently human intervention required to restart pods after PVC resized.) Requires ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes feature gate.
- [x] Automatic PVC resizing. The controller increases PVC size once storage reaches a configured threshold; e.g. 80% full.
- [ ] Bootstrap config using the chain registry. Query the chain registry and set config based on the registry.
- [ ] Validate p2p such as peers, seeds, etc. and filter out non-responsive peers.
- [ ] HPA support.
- [ ] Automatic upgrades. Controller monitors governance and performs upgrade without any human intervention.
- [ ] Corrupt data recovery. Detect when a PVC may have corrupted data. Restore data from a recent VolumeSnapshot.
- [x] Safe, automatic backups. Create periodic VolumeSnapshots of PVCs while minimizing chance of data corruption during snapshot creation.
