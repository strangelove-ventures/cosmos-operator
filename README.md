Cosmos Operator is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for blockchains built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). 

The long-term vision of this operator is to allow you to "configure it and forget it". 

## Motivation

Kubernetes provides a foundation for creating highly-available, scalable, fault-tolerant applications. 
Additionally, Kubernetes provides well-known DevOps patterns and abstractions vs. 
traditional DevOps which often requires "re-inventing the wheel".

Furthermore, the Operator Pattern allows us to mix infrastructure with business logic, 
thus minimizing human intervention and human error.

# Disclaimers

* Only tested on GKE. Although kubernetes is portable, YMMV with AWS, Azure, or other kubernetes providers. Or it may not work at all.
* Requires a recent version of kubernetes: v1.23+.
* CosmosFullNode: The chain must be built from the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
* CosmosFullNode: The controller requires [heighliner](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner) images. If you build your own image, you will need a shell `sh` and set the uid:gid to 1025:1025.
* CosmosFullNode: May not work with all chains built with the Cosmos SDK. (Some chains diverge from common conventions.)

# CRDs

## CosmosFullNode

Status: v1, stable

CosmosFullNode is the flagship CRD. Its purpose is to deploy highly-available, fault-tolerant RPC nodes. 
It will eventually support validator sentries, persistent peers, and seeds, but is currently only suitable for RPC.

The CosmosFullNode controller acts like a hybrid between a StatefulSet and a Deployment.
Like a StatefulSet, each pod has a corresponding persistent volume to manage blockchain data.
But, you can also configure rolling updates similar to a Deployment.

As of this writing, Strangelove has been running CosmosFullNode in production for many weeks.

View a [minimal example](./config/samples/cosmos_v1_cosmosfullnode.yaml) or a [full example](./config/samples/cosmos_v1_cosmosfullnode_full.yaml).

### Roadmap

Disclaimer: Strangelove has not committed to these enhancements. They represent ideas that may or may not come to fruition. 
Currently, is no timeline for any of these potential features.

* Scheduled upgrades. Set a halt height and image version. The controller performs a rolling update with the new image version after the committed halt height.
* Support configuration suitable for validator sentries.
* Reliable, persistent peer support.
* Support configuration suitable for seeds.
* Quicker p2p discovery using private peers. 
* Advanced readiness probe behavior. (The tendermint rpc status endpoint is not always reliable.)
* Automatic rollout for PVC resizing. (Currently human intervention required to restart pods after PVC resized.)
* Automatic PVC resizing. The controller increases PVC size once storage reaches a configured threshold; e.g. 80% full. (This may be a different CRD.)
* Bootstrap config using the chain registry. Query the chain registry and set config based on the registry.
* Validate p2p such as peers, seeds, etc. and filter out non-responsive peers.
* HPA support.
* Automatic upgrades. Controller monitors governance and performs upgrade without any human intervention.
* Corrupt data recovery. Detect when a PVC may have corrupted data. Restore data from a recent VolumeSnapshot.
* Safe, automatic backups. Create periodic VolumeSnapshots of PVCs while minimizing chance of data corruption during snapshot creation.

### Why not a StatefulSet?

CosmosFullNode gives you more control over individual pod and pvc pairs vs. a StatefulSet. You can configure pod/pvc 
pairs differently using the `instanceOverrides` feature. For example, data may become corrupt and the human operator needs 
to tweak or restore data.

Additionally, each pod requires slightly different config (such as peer settings in config.toml). Therefore, a blanket 
template as found in StatefulSet will not suffice.

In summary, we wanted precise control over resources so using an existing controller such as StatefulSet, Deployment, 
ReplicaSet, etc. was not a good fit.

## StatefulJob

Status: v1alpha1, experimental only

Currently, StatefulJob is alpha and will likely have backwards breaking changes. At this time, **we do not recommend using it in production**.

The StatefulJob is a means to process persistent data from a recent [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) of a PVC created from a CosmosFullNode. 
It periodically creates a job and PVC using the most recent VolumeSnapshot as its data source. It mounts the PVC as a volume into all of the job's pods. 
It's similar to a CronJob but does not offer advanced scheduling via a crontab. 

Strangelove uses it to compress and upload snapshots of chain data.
