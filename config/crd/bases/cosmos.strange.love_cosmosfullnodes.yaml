                                                    An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                                    user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                                    removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                                    Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                                Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass.
                                                This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If

                                                The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already

                                                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.

                                                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain

                                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,

                                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:

                                                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                                                            - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                                              skew.
                                                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                                            It's a required field.

                                            Prefer AddrbookURL if the file is in a conventional format.
                                            The available shell commands are from docker image ghcr.io/strangelove-ventures/infra-toolkit, including wget and curl.
                                            Save the file to env var $ADDRBOOK_FILE.
                                            E.g. curl https://url-to-addrbook.com > $ADDRBOOK_FILE
                                            Takes precedence over AddrbookURL.
                                            Hint: Use "set -eux" in your script.
                                            Available env vars:
                                            $HOME: The home directory.
                                            $ADDRBOOK_FILE: The location of the final address book file.
                                            $CONFIG_DIR: The location of the config dir that houses the address book file. Used for extracting from archives. The archive must have a single file called "addrbook.json".

                                            Use AddrbookScript if the chain has an unconventional file format or address book location.

                                            $CONFIG_DIR: The location of the config dir that houses the genesis file. Used for extracting from archives. The archive must have a single file called "genesis.json".
                                        type: string
                                    genesisURL:

                                            If not set, uses the genesis file created from the init subcommand. (This behavior may be desirable for new chains or testing.)
                                            The operator detects and properly handles the following file extensions:
                                            .json, .json.gz, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.gzip, .zip

                                            The chain's home directory is where the chain's data and config is stored.
                                            This should be a single folder. E.g. .gaia, .dydxprotocol, .osmosisd, etc.
                                            Set via --home flag when running the binary.
                                            If empty, defaults to "cosmos" which translates to `chain start --home /home/operator/cosmos`.
                                            Historically, several chains do not respect the --home and save data outside --home which crashes the pods.
                                            Therefore, this option was introduced to mitigate those edge cases, so that you can specify the home directory
                                            to match the chain's default home dir.

                                            ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any images
                                            in pods that reference this ServiceAccount. ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets
                                            can be mounted in the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet.

                                                    reports itself as in-sync, the pod is deleted. The CosmosFullNodeController creates a new pod to replace it.
                                                    Pod deletion respects the CosmosFullNode.Spec.RolloutStrategy and will not delete more pods than set
                                                    by the strategy to prevent downtime.
                                                    This workaround is necessary to mitigate a bug in the Cosmos SDK and/or CometBFT where pods report themselves as
                                                    in-sync even though they can lag thousands of blocks behind the chain tip and cannot catch up.
                                                    A "rebooted" pod /status reports itself correctly and allows it to catch up to chain tip.

                                            expand while a pod is attached to it, thus eliminating the need to restart pods.
                                            If you cluster does not support ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes, you will need to manually restart pods after
                                            resizing is complete.

                                                    Either a percentage (e.g. 20%) or a resource storage quantity (e.g. 100Gi).

                                                    If a percentage, the existing capacity increases by the percentage.

                                            Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. The minimum max unavailable is 1.
